## 📝 Summary
> ⚠️ **Branch Warning**
>
> Please do not switch to another branch. Work only on the assigned branch for this MP. The grading system expects your code to be submitted on that branch.

In this MP, you will learn the fundamental knowledge of the file system by adding two features to xv6: **large files** and **symbolic links** (including cycle prevention). We strongly recommend you read xv6 book while you trace the code. This gives you a quick overview of how xv6 implements its file system.

The core data structures (`struct dinode` and `struct inode`) have been pre-modified for you in the template. Your task is to implement the logic to handle these new structures and features.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

Before starting this machine problem, ensure you have completed the initial environment setup.

1. **Initialize the environment**:
   ```bash
   ./mp.sh init
   ```

2. **Launch xv6**:
   ```bash
   ./mp.sh qemu
   ```

3. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   ./mp.sh clean
   ```

Refer to the [Handbook](./doc/handbook.md) for more details on the `mp.sh` toolkit.

## 💻 Part 1: Large Files (40 points)

### Description

In this problem, you have to increase the maximum size of an xv6 file. Currently, xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks (12 direct + 1 singly-indirect). Your task is to implement **doubly-indirect** blocks to support much larger files (up to 131,338 blocks).

The template uses a layout of **10 direct blocks, 1 singly-indirect block, and 2 doubly-indirect blocks**.

### Implementation Details

You need to modify the following functions in `kernel/fs.c`:

1. **`bmap()`**:
   - Locate the logic for the "To do: bigfile" block (around line 411).
   - Implement the mapping for logical block numbers falling into the two doubly-indirect slots (`addrs[11]` and `addrs[12]`).
   - You must allocate indirect and data blocks on demand using `balloc()`.
   - Use `bread()`, `log_write()`, and `brelse()` correctly to navigate the levels of indirection.

2. **`itrunc()`**:
   - Locate the logic for the "To do: bigfile" block (around line 459).
   - Implement the logic to free all data blocks and indirect blocks associated with the two doubly-indirect slots.
   - Failure to free all blocks will cause a disk space leak, which may cause subsequent tests to fail.

### Test Specifications

| Test Case           | Type    | Description                                                        | Points |
| :------------------ | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| `public testcase 1` | Public  | Small file write/read test (270 blocks).                           | 15     |
| `public testcase 2` | Public  | Larger file write/read test (6666 blocks).                         | 15     |
| `private testcases` | Private | Stress tests to verify doubly-indirect logic and disk consistency. | 10     |


### Guidelines and Hints

- The layout is pre-defined in `kernel/fs.h`: `10 direct + 1 singly + 2 doubly`.
- `MAXFILE` is calculated as `10 + 256 + 2 * 256 * 256 = 131,338` blocks.
- Do not use recursion when traversing blocks to avoid kernel stack overflow.
- Always `brelse()` a buffer once you are done with it to avoid `bget: no buffers` panic.

## 💻 Part 2: Symbolic Link & Cycle Prevention (60 points)

### Description

In this problem, you will add symbolic links to xv6. A symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a path to another file or directory. When the system encounters a symbolic link during path resolution, it should follow the link to the target.

You must also implement **cycle prevention**. If a chain of symbolic links forms a loop or becomes excessively long, the system must return an error.

### Implementation Details

You need to modify the following locations:

1. **`sys_symlink()`** in `kernel/sysfile.c`:
   - Implement the body of the system call.
   - Create a new inode of type `T_SYMLINK`.
   - Write the target path string into the inode's data blocks using `writei()`.

2. **`sys_open()`** in `kernel/sysfile.c`:
   - Add logic to follow symbolic links when a file is opened.
   - If `O_NOFOLLOW` is specified in the flags, the symbolic link itself should be opened instead of following it.
   - Implement cycle detection: keep track of visited inodes and fail if a cycle is detected or if the number of hops exceeds 100.

3. **`namex()`** in `kernel/fs.c`:
   - Add logic to follow directory symbolic links when they appear as intermediate components of a path (e.g., in `/a/link_to_dir/b`, `link_to_dir` must be followed).

4. **`sys_chdir()`** in `kernel/sysfile.c`:
   - Add logic to follow the symbolic link if the target of `chdir` is a link pointing to a directory.

| `private testcases`        | Private | Complex cycle detection and `O_NOFOLLOW` verification. | 8      |


### Guidelines and Hints

- The target of a symbolic link does not need to exist when the link is created.
- Symbolic links to directories should behave just like the directories they point to.
